 * For example, a tree can be made from character-counts using
 * a priority queue. Alternatively, a tree could be made from
 * an input stream when unhuffing if the huff process stored the
 * tree in the file in some format.
 * <P>
 * Typically classes that implement this interface will supply
 * state to the class via a constuctor or some other method so
 * that makeRoot will work (since makeRoot has no parameters).
